# Advanced Calculator

This project parses a calculation into expressions, and then evalulates it.

- Probably fast,
- Maybe efficient,
- But memory safe (_Rust_ #1)

## TODOs

- [x] tokenization
- [x] expression parsing
- [x] evalulation
- [x] brackets
- [ ] negative numbers
- [x] 100% test coverage
- [ ] substitution
- [ ] functions
