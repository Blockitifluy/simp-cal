_Simple Calculate_

This project parses a calculation into expressions, and then evaluates it.

- Probably fast,
- Maybe efficient,
- But memory safe (_Rust_ #1)

## TODOs

- [x] tokenization
- [x] expression parsing
- [x] evaluation
- [x] brackets
- [x] negative numbers
- [x] 100% test coverage
- [ ] substitution
- [ ] functions
